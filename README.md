This kinda doesn't work because I was struggling to actually put the data I got from the backend using axios.get on the frontend because root.render only works when the ElementID comes before the root.render command. The issue is, the div whose id is was using
as the root was in a return statement so I can't put anything after the return statement. I tried to fix it for a while, but this is all I have.
